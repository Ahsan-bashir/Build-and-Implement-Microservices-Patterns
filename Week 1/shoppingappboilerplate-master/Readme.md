Problem Statement â€“ SoppingApp

It is increasingly difficult for businesses to remain competitive in the retail. This is due to the high rental fees necessary to maintain a physical store and the difficulty of hiring lower-skilled sales assistants. In addition, consumers are increasingly shopping online on platforms such as Amazon, AliBaba etc. Even big companies as Reliance, Walmart, Apple have developed online shops and e-commerce apps, making the market even more competitive.

EBuy Group is the leading retailer. EBuy has decided to build a new and independent e-commerce app. Consider a shopping application that enables users to shop for products on any smart device. The application provides multiple features to all its registered users. The user needs to register with the application in order to access some of its features. The goal was to design an app that is seamless to use and interact with. 

Consider a shopping application that enables users to shop for products on any smart device. The application provides multiple features to all its registered users. The user needs to register with the application in order to access some of its features. Let us create multiple microservices for the application.
The user must first register with the application.
The user must login with credentials such as id, password.
The user can access the features provided by the like adding products, deleting products etc.
